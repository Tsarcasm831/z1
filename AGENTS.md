# Instructions for Agents

Welcome to the Z1 Agent Workflow. All contributors must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure project stability, transparency, and traceability.

---

## ✅ Environment Requirements

- Use **Node.js 18.x** or later when running any scripts or tools.
- After switching environments or installing dependencies, run:
  ```bash
  node --version
to confirm the correct version is active.

📜 Changelog Policy (MANDATORY)
🔥 Every change made to the project must be reflected in the changelog. No exceptions.

A changelog entry must be created or updated for each action (new feature, fix, tweak, removal).

Use a timestamp format of: MMDDYY-HHMM for each entry.

Example: 062424-1530 (June 24, 2024 at 3:30 PM)

Entries should be placed under the appropriate module and section:

✨ Added

🛠 Changed

🐛 Fixed

🔥 Removed

If no changelog entry is submitted alongside your update, your contribution is considered incomplete.

🧪 Testing Policy
There are currently no automated tests for this project.

All testing must be performed manually — you break it, you fix it.

💬 Final Note
Be meticulous. Be traceable. Keep Z1’s development log pristine for your fellow agents — and your future self.
